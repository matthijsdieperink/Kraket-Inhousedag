/* The main.css file imports all other CSS files and their classes
In the templates/partials/header.html, this file is imported again, such that
the pages have all CSS classes available.

Note: The templates/partials/header.html files also imports the Bootstrap CSS.
Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
Bootstrap has a lot of out-of-the-box classes which can be used.

Feel free to write your own css classes in the files ('content.css' and 'topnav.css')
which are imported below. Or create your own css file (don't forget to import it here).
